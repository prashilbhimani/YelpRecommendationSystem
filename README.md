# YelpRecommendationSystem

This is the project for CSCI 5502 at University of Colorado Boulder. 
We have used the dataset from the Yelp Dataset Challenge.

The team members are Hemang Bansal, Prashil Bhimani and Sandesh D.

# Abstract

We provide a recommendation system where we use the tags/key features of the text review from the user, which is a sentimental analysis based recommendation system.
The review-based tags/features are used to improve the accuracy of recommendation system, as user rating are too coarse grained to build the recommendation system. 
Here we mainly build the recommendation system in three major steps. 
First cleaning the reviews/data based on the language,rating,state and postal codes. 
Secondly doing a extensive sentiment analysis using the TextBlob from  Twitter and NLTK tool to generate the tags/key features involved in the user reviews
Finally building the recommendation system using the tags and postal codes.

# Scripts

The scripts are designed to work and the subset of the original dataset. The script to generate the subset is also commited.
The final recommendation is generated by Recommendation.py. The tags are generated by NGrams.py.
